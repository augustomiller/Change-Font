## 1. Preamble

This application helps children who are in the literacy phase. The child types the letter with the font of the Press type, which is learned in the nursery school and the system converts it to the Cursive type font, which is the form used for literacy.

In this way, she focuses on learning the new one and does not lose focus trying to remember what the desired letter would be like.

## 2. Project summary

In this project we built an application where we can help as children who are in the literacy phase. The principle idea is to keep the student focused
in learning without wasting time to remember or research what a certain letter written in cursive would look like.

## 3. User Story

Os usuários em pontencial, são educadores, e ou alunos que está na fase de alfabetização.

O desejo de aprender a escrever da forma cursiva e deixar a velha fonte do tipo imprensa para traz, faz com que o aplicativo Change Fonte ajude de forma
efetiva nessa nova etapa da educação.

## 4. General considerations

The project was developed in a sprint of one week each, where it was divided into two stories:

- **First Story:**

As a user I would like to have a simple and quick display of the transformation of the letters typed in the press font into the cursive font.

- **Second Story:**

I would like the page to be simple and objective, as I would not like to be distracted by a visually polluted page.
